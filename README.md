#### Brief Description of the project - Sinhala inscriptions and Palm Leaf Manuscripts are critical to understanding the history, culture, and traditions of ancient Sri Lanka. These manuscripts offer valuable insights into various aspects of life, such as governance, religion, trade, language evolution, and societal norms. Despite their importance, these historical texts face numerous challenges, primarily due to deterioration caused by time, climate, and improper storage. Additionally, deciphering these texts is a complex task due to the intricacies of the ancient Sinhala script, inconsistent handwriting styles, and the presence of noise, damage, and missing sections. Our research seeks to address these challenges by developing a mobile application that identifies, interprets, and preserves Sinhala inscriptions and Palm Leaf Manuscripts, thereby ensuring the longevity and accessibility of this invaluable heritage.

The primary goal of our research is to create a robust and user-friendly mobile application that utilizes advanced visual character recognition technologies. By combining computer vision, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP), the application will be capable of recognizing Sinhala characters from scanned images of inscriptions and manuscripts. These characters will then be translated and interpreted, providing both Sinhala and English outputs. This dual-language interpretation is crucial for making the information accessible to a broader audience, including international researchers and history enthusiasts who may not be proficient in Sinhala.

Our application offers several key features to meet the needs of epigraphers, archaeologists, and historians. First, it incorporates Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tailored specifically for ancient Sinhala scripts. This customized OCR system is trained to identify unique patterns and structures found in ancient Sinhala characters, which often differ significantly from modern Sinhala. To achieve this, the system utilizes high-quality annotated datasets of historical inscriptions and manuscripts. Collaborations with museums, archives, and academic institutions provide access to these datasets, ensuring the system's accuracy and effectiveness.

In addition to character recognition, the application addresses the issue of deteriorated text by integrating noise removal and error correction techniques. These techniques enhance the readability of damaged or faded characters, allowing for more accurate interpretations. The system also features algorithms for character boundary detection, ensuring that even texts with irregular spacing or overlapping symbols can be accurately processed.

Once the characters are identified, the application stores the interpreted data in a digital repository. This repository serves as a centralized archive for Sinhala inscriptions and Palm Leaf Manuscripts, making these historical texts available to researchers worldwide. The repository also allows for metadata tagging, enabling users to search and categorize documents based on various criteria, such as time period, location, or content type.

The application is designed with a user-friendly interface to facilitate ease of use for individuals with varying levels of technical expertise. Whether used by professional archaeologists in the field, epigraphers conducting detailed analyses, or history enthusiasts exploring Sri Lankaâ€™s cultural heritage, the application ensures that everyone can benefit from the insights offered by these ancient texts.

By digitizing and preserving Sinhala inscriptions and manuscripts, our research not only aids in the protection of these cultural artifacts but also fosters the dissemination of knowledge. In an era where technology plays a pivotal role in preserving heritage, our solution helps bridge the gap between the past and the future. It allows current and future generations to explore and learn from the rich history embedded in these ancient texts. Furthermore, it opens new avenues for academic research, linguistic studies, and cultural education.

In conclusion, our mobile application represents a significant step forward in the preservation and study of Sri Lanka's historical heritage. By leveraging modern technology to solve age-old challenges, we contribute to the safeguarding of Sinhala inscriptions and Palm Leaf Manuscripts, ensuring that these cultural treasures continue to inform and inspire for generations to come.
