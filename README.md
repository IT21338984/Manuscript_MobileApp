# 📜 Manuscript Language & Era Identification System

This is a research-based mobile and backend system designed to identify the language (Pali, Sanskrit, Sinhala) and historical era of ancient palm leaf manuscripts using machine learning and multi-layered feature extraction.

Built using **Flutter (Android Studio)** and **Python**, the system aims to modernize and democratize the traditionally subjective process of manuscript analysis.

## 🔬 Research Context

This project is part of an academic initiative to preserve, decode, and contextualize Sinhalese epigraphy and palm leaf manuscripts using state-of-the-art AI.

- **Predictive Intelligence**: Beyond classification, it estimates manuscript origin and historical context.
- **Democratized Access**: Empowers non-experts to study ancient scripts.
- **Objective Evaluation**: Reduces subjectivity in manuscript analysis.
- **Cultural Preservation**: Enhances understanding of ancient Sri Lankan heritage.
- **Academic Rigor**: Research-grade implementation with measurable outcomes

## 📖 Abstract

This research presents a novel system for language and era identification of palm leaf manuscripts using advanced machine learning methods and a multi-layered feature extraction pipeline. Historically, manuscript interpretation was reliant on expert knowledge, often subjective. In contrast, this system introduces algorithmic predictability and accessibility, enabling accurate and insightful cultural preservation. It identifies, classifies, and contextualizes manuscripts in ways not previously possible, representing a paradigm shift in the study of ancient texts.
